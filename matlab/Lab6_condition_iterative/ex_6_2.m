%{ 
 Convergence of Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel method are not related to each other.
 As we could see they can both diverge or be convergent or also just one can
 converge.
 It always depends on the matrix. They both have some advantages. Since in Jacobi
 method each component of the approximation of the solution is obtained
 using information at the previous iteration, the algorithm is highly
 parallelizable. This is not possible for Gauss-Seidel method, since each 
 component is obtained using the information on the other components
 already computed at the current iteration. However this smarter use of 
 the information, can speed up convergence.
