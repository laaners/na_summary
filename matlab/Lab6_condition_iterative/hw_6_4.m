% Four iterations are performed in both cases, independently on the tolerance values we considered.
% Notice that the last increment is actually zero!

% The spectral radius is very small.

eig(Bj)
rhoBj  = max( abs( eig(Bj) ) )

% Indeed, computing by hand the eigenvalues we see that
% lambda_1 = lambda_2 = lambda_3 = 0, so the spectral radius is actually 0.

% Compute the cube of Bj
Bj^2
Bj^3        % At the third step we get the null matrix.

% Thus, for all k > 3
% Jacobi method has converged to the exact solution
