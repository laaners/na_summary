% Bj= inv(D)*(D-A); the following implementation is faster as declared by
% Matlab
Bj = D \ (D-A) 
% Bgs =  inv(D-E)*(D-E-A); the following implementation is faster as declared by
% Matlab
Bgs =  (D-E) \ (D-E-A)

% The matrices do not have particular properties like being strictly diagonally dominant or symmetric and positive definite.
norm(Bj)
norm(Bgs)

% Moreover, the 1,2 and infinity norms of Bj and Bgs for all matrices A are
% ALL bigger than 1. So we cannot use this argument to conclude convergence
% for any case.
% Hence we have to compute the spectral radii of both matrices to determine
% whether the methods are convergent or not.
