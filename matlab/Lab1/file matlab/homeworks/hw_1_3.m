% 	No bad behaviour is observed since the 1 in both formulas dominates the sum and numerical cancellation does not occur. 
%   Therefore both expression can be accepted.
% 
% 	Instead, if the sum were not dominated by the term 1 (or if you didn't notice that), 
%   the following combination could have been proposed
% 
% 	e^{-x} ~ {1}/{1 + x + {1}/{2}x^2 + {1}/{6}x^3 + ...}, x > 0;
% 	       ~ 1 - x + {1}/{2}x^2 - {1}/{6}x^3 +      ... , x <=0.
% 	
% 	The choice of the previous expression for x > 0 should not display any numerical cancellation because all the terms in the sum are positive. Similarly, the choice for x < 0 grants that the terms -x^{2k+1} are positive, again avoiding any numerical cancellation.
